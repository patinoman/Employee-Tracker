## Installation

Download the source code from my repo and unzip the file onto your computer. You should have Node and MySQL workbench installed into your machine.

On the MySQL workbench, run a `schema.sql` to create a database (`employee_db`). Run the script `seeds.sql` to populate the db with simple data. Initiate the app using `npm start` on the command line to access the db.

## Usage

Using the command `npm start` initializes the app to start the CLI. From there, use the arrow and Enter keys to navigate through the given prompts and execute commands as you'd like.
